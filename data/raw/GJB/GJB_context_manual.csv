1285,"Long Time Ago, Caesar Boy",Boat Song; Work Song; Sailor's Song; Funeral Song; Hauling Song,"Work songs related to the sea are found in most parts of the Caribbean. Although many songs in this category have an African flavor, others clearly draw on European traditions. The British Caribbean in particular is known as a rich repository for old sea chanteys. This launching song from Carriacou appears to be derived in part from one such chantey, known to collectors as “A Long Time Ago” or “In ’Frisco Bay.” This chantey, which was very popular on English and American ships during the nineteenth century, was originally a halyard song, used for hoisting or lowering sails. In Carriacou, however, it is used for very different purposes, such as launching schooners or honoring deceased sailors at wakes. 

Whereas many versions of “A Long Time Ago” make mention of ’Frisco Bay, this one refers to “Mobile Bay,” which would seem to lend support to those who have argued that West Indian workers and sailors played a major role in the development of British and American chanteying. (Mobile, Alabama, was an important cotton-trading center and one of the bustling American seaports where West Indian sailors and those from other nations met, caroused, and exchanged songs during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.) Although the singing style of the launching song heard here resembles that of British or American chanteymen, Carriacouan sailors use the song to honor the spirits of deceased friends and relatives, thus investing it with a new meaning that faithfully reflects the religious concepts of their African ancestors.",0,0,0,0,0

Brown, in his collection North Carolina Folklore, reports a version twelve stanzas long, dating from 1911. A. K. Davis lists six texts in Traditional Ballads of Virginia. Henry Whitter made a commercial record of the song in the late 1920s, and Molly O’Day recorded it with five-string banjo for Columbia in the late 1940s.

1440,When We Step out on the Road,Carnaval Music,"This recording was made at a critical time in the history of Carnival and calypso in Grenada, when older forms were being supplanted by newer traditions imported from Trinidad. Up to the late 1950s, Grenada was home to a distinctive, local Afro-Caribbean Carnival based on folk traditions and costumed characters of its own, such as Shortknee and Pierrot Grenade (some of which had earlier influenced the Carnival of Trinidad). Well-known local calypso singers such as Papa Edmund and Lord Roamer usually performed with village string bands featuring some combination of banjo, guitar, cuatro, and chorus singers. These calypsonians were still known, as elsewhere in the French-influenced Caribbean, as “chantwells.” In the late 1950s, the Grenadian chantwells Lord Melody (a different individual from the better-known Lord Melody of Trinidad) and Quo Vadis introduced organized calypso tents and formal competitions based on the Trinidadian model. Calypso in Grenada, as in the other Anglophone islands, soon came to be dominated by the sounds emanating from Trinidad, a trend that continues today. The older string-band sound heard in this selection has almost disappeared from Carnival in Grenada, having long ago been displaced by the more “modern” strains of steel band and soca music. The lyrics of the song reflect the subversive spirit of Carnival, humorously overturning the norms of “proper” everyday social life; temporarily freed from normal constraints, the “saga gals” (fancy, showy, dressed-up girls) leave their watchful mothers at home and venture out on their own to take over the town.",0,1,0,0,0

1336,Thumrī,Thumrī; Tan-Singing,"Thumrī, tan-singing, the term 'thumri' is derived from the Hindi verb thumakna meaning 'to walk with dancing steps so as to make the ankle-bells tinkle', connected with dance, dramatic gestures, mild eroticism, evocative love poetry, and folk songs.

Despite a general lack of exposure to North Indian classical music, generations of Indo-Caribbean musicians, drawing on their fragmentary knowledge and their own innovative spirit, cultivated a “local classical” genre that came to be known as tan singing. Sung at weddings and other functions, tan singing evolved into a unique idiom, with thoroughly idiosyncratic versions of North Indian classical and semiclassical genres like dhrupad, ghazal, and especially thumri, heard here. 

Trinidadian thumri bears little resemblance to its North Indian counterpart: it is distinguished primarily by its sequential rhythmic structure. This includes a curious metrical modulation during the initial sections, in which the downbeat shifts by one beat between the refrain and verse passages, before accelerating in an extendedbarhti  (in India, laggi ) section. As is standard, the singer here doubles his vocal line on harmonium, while being accompanied by dholak and dantal, a steel rod struck with a U-shaped clapper. Although in severe decline in Guyana and Suriname, tan singing is still relatively vital in Trinidad.

The text to this song, as in most tan singing, is drawn from published verse anthologies obtained from India. This verse contains the pen name of the mystical poet Kabir (1440—1518), perhaps a misattribution.",0,1,0,0,0

9198,Ciocârlia,Animal Song; Concert Piece; Orchestra,"During the Communist years (1944–1989), large, concert-style folk orchestras came into being in the capital and various provincial towns and cities. These orchestras, modeled after the Russian Moiseev ensemble, were organized by the Communist authorities to create a spectacular national music, presenting a model of discipline and coordination, and hence to co-opt and control the somewhat anarchic field of traditional music and musicians. The orchestras of thirty to sixty players (traditional groups had only three to four musicians, recently five to seven), led by a conductor, were composed of excellent virtuoso instrumentalists (lªutar). Though required to learn musical notation, most did not do so and often managed to preserve a rather beautiful traditional style of playing, especially in the 1950s and 1960s. 

When it began, the Barbu Lªutaru Orchestra — the most famous in the country at the time of this recording — was under the auspices of the Folklore Institute. Tiberiu Alexandru played an important role in choosing its repertoire and style of interpretation. It was entirely supported by the state and was heavily promoted nationally. No survey of folk and popular music in Romania can ignore the folk orchestras of the Communist period or overlook their widespread influence. Thus the present record brightly concludes with a concert piece by the Barbu Lªutaru Orchestra playing with the famous panpipe player Fªnicª Luca, featured here on “Cioc<rlia” (The Lark).",0,0,0,0,0

Historically, the Baoule people do not have tribal festival, however, in 1954 the Superior Chief decided to initiate a festival. This celebration takes place for three days during the month of August, and some of the best musicians are invited to perform in the chief's village of Sakassou. The festival does not have any ceremonial Significance and is given only for the recreation of the people involved, and to provide additional incentive to Baoule musicians to perfect their artistry. During the first two days of the festival independent groups perform the music and dance in which they are most skilled. However, on the last day capsule performances before the assembled chiefs and elders in a chain of competitive performances.
